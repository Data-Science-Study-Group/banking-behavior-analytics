# Banking Behavior Analytics

*Consumer banking behavior examples from the PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge dataset.*

Financial transactions data are closely guarded by banks, which makes (anonymized) public datasets almost non-existent. This is unfortunate, since financial behavior has many interesting particularities. I've worked within banks in the past and often felt like sharing related insights. 

Thankfully, a Czech bank did build such a dataset for a Data Mining challenge in 1999, and it seems that this remains - 20 years later - the only one. Also known as the "Berka dataset", I got my copy [here]( https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions) (and put a backup [here](http://data.paulosalem.com/datasets/pkdd99_discovery_challenge_banking_dataset.zip)).

The Jupyter notebook `transactions.ipynb` provided in the present repository contains examples of individual customer behaviors extracted from this dataset. A related `transactions.html` export is available for easier viewing. To re-run the notebook or do your own analyses, please download the dataset either from [where I found it](https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions) or [where I saved it afterwards](http://data.paulosalem.com/datasets/pkdd99_discovery_challenge_banking_dataset.zip).
